== Overview

This Personal Portfolio Page showcases what I have contributed in the project and the documentation for
each contributions.

Inventory manager is for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who prefer to use a
desktop app to manage their shop inventory. More importantly, it is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

In this Inventory Manager, I have designed and implemented the authentication component and
user management component. This two components provides the inventory manager on the ability
to authenticate and authorize users to manage the inventory.
