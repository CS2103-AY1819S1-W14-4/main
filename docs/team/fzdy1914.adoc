== PROJECT: Inventory Manager

:sectnums:
== Overview

This portfolio aims to showcases my ability to work in a software development team. It also documents
my contribution to the project of our team, the *Inventory Manager*. There are mainly two part of my contributions,
 code and documentations.

*Inventory Manager* is for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who prefer to use a
desktop app to manage their shop inventory. More importantly, it is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It has mainly three core features, including item management,
sales management and reporting module. It also has two other special features including
user authentication and purchase order management.

For *Inventory Manager*, I have designed and implemented the reporting module of the product.
It mainly provides the users with the ability to export and import the data of  *Inventory Manager* to
and from the outer system.
