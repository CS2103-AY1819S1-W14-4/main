== Introduction
// tag::projectIntro[]
Inventory manager is designed for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who prefer to use a
desktop app to manage their shop inventory. More importantly, it is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It will allow various users to perform multiple inventory
management tasks such as creating sales, generating reports, creating purchase orders
and more.
