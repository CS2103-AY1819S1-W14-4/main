== Introduction

Inventory manager is for Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) who prefer to use a
desktop app to manage their shop inventory. More importantly, it is optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of
a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It will allow various users to perform multiple inventory
management tasks such as creating sales, generating reports, creating purchase orders
and more.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `InventoryManager.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
