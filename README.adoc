* It is a Java application which aims to help supermarkets' stakeholders to manage the inventory.
* It is *written in OOP fashion*. This will enable the application to model the supermarket realistically and help stakeholders to manage the inventory smoothly.
* What's different from https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3[level 3]:
** A more sophisticated GUI that includes a list panel and an in-built Browser.
** More test cases, including automated GUI testing.
** Support for _Build Automation_ using Gradle and for _Continuous Integration_ using Travis CI.
